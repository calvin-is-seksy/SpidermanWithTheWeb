# Web Crawling and Web Scraping # 

Initially handed to me as a coding challenge from Notable Health, but was rejected oh well. Thanks to them I've been introduced to this cool web crawling/scraping framework called Pyppeteer. It is a Python wrapper of Puppeteer, but it does a fantastic job. Wasn't prepared to have to whip out so much javascript as parameters within function calls, but twas a fun ride. 

Moving on, I am reformatting this repo into a fun little side project where I will aim to use this framework to remotely reserve library rooms at my school since they always get filled up so fast. We'll see where it goes haha

Usage: 
```
$ python dataGovScraper.py __topic__ __maxElement__ 
```
